# Polynomial Regression
Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y

**y=b0 + x*b1 + x^2b2....**

# code.py
This file contains the code for creation of polynomial regression model using the 'sklearn' library. The sub module 'preprocessing' is imported for PolynomialFeatures class. This class is used to transform the feature data into interactive matrix form. The model is then created using the Linear Regression class from linear_model sub module.
